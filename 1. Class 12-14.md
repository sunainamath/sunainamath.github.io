We want to make programs which interact with the users.

First compilable program ``main = putStr "Hello, world!\n"``

save it ( write in ghc ) and then run by ./name

- ``putStr str`` prints the string ``str`` on screen

### () and IO()

- The type (), pronounced unit 
- Consists of a single value, also denoted by () 
- Can be used to model nothing

IO is a type constructor, just like Maybe or []

We know Haskell is known for :
- Lazy eval
- Pure functions i.e A function returns exactly the same result every time it's called with the same set of arguments.There are no side effects.

A value of type ``IO a`` is a computation which when executed 
- Can possibly give side effects
- returns a result of type a

 Kind of side effects 
 - Printing on screen 
 - Reading a user input from the terminal 
 - generating from the terminal
 - Opening or closing a file 
 - Changing a directory 
 - Writing into a file

### Actions
IO actions ( or just actions):  can interact with the real world

_Side effect_: Any observable effect other than the effect of returning the value.

- ``getChar :: IO Char``  has IO Char as we type and then result is Char. 

Try not to get confused with function type thing. IO Char is the type.

- We  have ``getLine :: IO String`` 

![[Screenshot from 2023-10-11 10-17-01.png]]
``putStr :: String -> IO ()``

For example: 

```haskell
main = putStr "Hello, world!\n"
```

Here, ``Hello, world!\n"`` is the string input. And the return value is nothing
_Note:_ Do not confuse it with getLine thing. In getLine, we don't give any input. 

- ``putStr"Hello world!"`` prints the string on the screen 
- ``putStrLn "Hello world!"`` prints the string and a newline ('``\n``') on the screen

_Note_: It is an action of return (not function) type IO a.
Any function that produces a side effect will have return type IO a 
Just as we _compose functions_, we can _chain actions_
### Do 

- We use the command do to chain multiple actions
- do makes the actions take effect in sequential order, one after the other
- the command ``do``
 ```haskell
 main = do 
	 putStrLn "Hello!" 
	 putStrLn "What's your name?"
```

_Note:_ 
```haskell
print x = putStrLn (show x)
```

### let, where, if-then-else
```haskell
main = do 
	act1 
	act2 where 
		act1 = putStr "Hello, " 
		act2 = putStrLn "world!"
```

``` haskell
main = let fibs = 0:1:zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
	in do
		print( fibs!!5)
		print( fibs!!10)
```

### More functions

- ``print :: Show a -> a -> IO () ``
Output a value of any printable type to the standard output (screen), and add a newline

- ``putChar :: Char -> IO ()``
Write the character argument to the screen

- `` getLine :: IO String``
Read a line from the standard input and return it as a string 
The side effect of getLine is the consumption of a line of input 
The return value is a string

- ``getChar :: IO Char`` 
Read the next character from the standard input

### Binding 
The syntax for binding is ``<-`` 

```haskell
main=do
	putStrLn "Hi,please enter your name"
	n <- getLine
	putStrLn("Hi " ++ n)
```

- getLine is not a string so we can not use ++ getLine

- We used putStrln to display in next line

_To stop buffering we use hflush etc_

```haskell
import System.IO ( hFlush, stdout )
main=do
	putStrLn "Hi,please enter your name"
	hFlush stdout
	n <- getLine
	putStrLn("Hi " ++ n)
```

- Import one whole file is too much time taking, so we import whatever functions we need
