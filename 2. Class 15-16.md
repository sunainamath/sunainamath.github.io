### Asymptotic complexity 

We say $f(x)=O(g(x))$ if there exists $c$ such that $|f(x)|<c(g(x)$ for all $x\ge x_0.$

- $an^2+bn+c=O(n^2)$ , take $k=|a|+|b|+|c|$
- Ignore constant factors, lower-order terms
- Typical complexities: $O(n), O(n \log n), O(n^k ), O(2^n )$

### Finding Time Complexities 

####  Concat
```haskell
[] ++ ys = ys 
(x:xs) ++ ys = x: xs ++ys
```

Time Complexity: It takes $xs+1$ steps. So $O(n)$.

#### elem
```haskell
elem :: Int -> [Int] -> Bool
elem i [] = False 
elem i (x:xs) = i == x || elem i xs
```

Time Complexity: It takes $xs$ steps. So $O(n)$. 

#### Reverse

```haskell
reverse [] = [] 
reverse (x:xs) = reverse xs ++ [x]
```

Let time complexity of reverse [] be $T(n)$. Then $T(0)=1$ and $T(n)=T(n-1)+n$. Solving, we get $T(n)=n^2$. 

#### Better Reverse

```haskell
reverse = revInto [] ( so a = [] here)
revInto a [] = [a]
revInto a (x:xs) = revInto (x:a) xs
```

Here we have 

```haskell
reverse [a,b,c] 
= revInto [] [a,b,c]
= revInto [a] [b,c]
= revInto [b:a] [c]
= revInto [c:[b,a]] []
= [c,b,a]

```

Clearly, it has time complexity $O(n)$.

#### Insert in Sorted list
- insert an element into a sorted list

```haskell
insert :: Int -> [Int]-> [Int]
insert n [] = [n]
insert n (x:xs) 
	|n <= x = n:x:xs
	|n>x = x: insert n xs 
```

This is going one element after the other, so it is  $O(n)$.

#### Sorting using Insert

- We use insert sort repeatedly 

```haskell
isort -> [Int]-> [Int]
isort [] = []
isort (x:xs) = insert x (isort xs)
```

Calculating the time complexity, we get $T(n)=O(n)+T(n-1)\implies T(n)= O(n^2)$.

We can use foldr too .

```haskell
isort = foldr insert []
```

#### Merging two sorted list

``` haskell
merger :: [Int]-> [Int]->[Int]
merger _ [xs] = [xs]
merger [xs] _ = [xs]
merger (x:xs) (y:ys) = if x <= y then x: merger (xs) (y:ys) else y: merger (x:xs) (ys)
```

The time complexity is $O(n)$ where $n=$ length xs + length ys

#### Merge Sort 

```haskell
sort :: [Int] -> [Int] 
sort [] = [] 
sort [x] = [x] 
sort xs = merge (sort front) (sort back) where 
	n = (length xs) `div` 2 
	(front, back) = splitAt n xs
```

Computing the time complexity: We get that $T(n)=2T(n/2)+cn$
Or we have $$2T(n/2)+cn=2^{\log_2n}T(1)+cn\log_2n=K+O(n\log_2n)=O(n\log n). $$
