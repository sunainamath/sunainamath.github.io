Apparently, A Maclaurin series is a Taylor series expansion of a function about $0$,

 $$f(x)=f(0)+f^'(0)x+f^('')(0))/(2!)x^2+(f^((3))(0))/(3!)x^3+\dots+(f^((n))(0))/(n!)x^n+\dots $$

A Taylor series is a series expansion of a function about a point. A one-dimensional Taylor series is an expansion of a real function $f(x)$ about a point $x=a$ is given by

 $$f(x)=f(a)+f^'(a)(x-a)+f^('')(a))/(2!)(x-a)^2+(f^((3))(a))/(3!)(x-a)^3+...+(f^((n))(a))/(n!)(x-a)^n+\dots $$
