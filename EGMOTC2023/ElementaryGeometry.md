# Elementary Geometry


Firstly, welcome to European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad Training camp 2023!I am so happy for all of you and very excited to teach all of you. 

Elementary Geometry doesn't have any prerequisite. So do not be scared. And now, let's try to do some maths!

I will be using Kenneth Peng's Geometry Through Problems as the main reference for the classes. 

<div class='example'> text= problem 1
  Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral. Let $M,N,P,Q$ be the midpoints of sides $AB,BC,CD,DA$. Prove that $MNPQ$ is a parallelogram.
</div>
<div class=`proof`>
  Consider $\Delta ABD$ and  $\Delta BDC$ .Note that $NP||BD||MQ$. Similarly, $NM||AC||PQ$. Hence the parallelogram.
</div>
<div class='example'> text= problem 2
 In $\Delta ABC$, $\angle A$ be right. Let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ onto $BC$. Prove that $AD^2=BD\cdot CD$.
</div>
<div class=`proof`>
  Note that $\Delta ADB\sim \Delta CDA$. So by similarity, we have $$\frac{AD}{BD}=\frac{CD}{AD}.$$
</div>
<div class='example'> text= problem 3 [Angle Bisector Theorem]
 In $\Delta ABC$, $\angle A$ be right. Let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ onto $BC$. Prove that $AD^2=BD\cdot CD$.
</div>
<div class=`proof`>
  Let $D\in CA$, such that $AD = AB$.Note that $BD||AS$. So by the Thalesâ€™ Proportionality Theorem, we are done!
</div>
