# Elementary Geometry


Firstly, welcome to European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad Training camp 2023!I am so happy for all of you and very excited to teach all of you. 

Elementary Geometry doesn't have any prerequisite. So do not be scared. And now, let's try to do some maths!

I will be using Kenneth Peng's Geometry Through Problems as the main reference for the classes. 

> [!note|*] Problem 1
> 
> Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral. Let $M,N,P,Q$ be the midpoints of sides $AB,BC,CD,DA$. Prove that $MNPQ$ is a parallelogram.

Consider $\Delta ABD$ and  $\Delta BDC$ .Note that $NP||BD||MQ$. Similarly, $NM||AC||PQ$. Hence the parallelogram.

> [!note|*] Problem 2
> 
In $\Delta ABC$, $\angle A$ be right. Let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ onto $BC$. Prove that $AD^2=BD\cdot CD$.


_Sketch_: Note that $\Delta ADB\sim \Delta CDA$. So by similarity, we have $$\frac{AD}{BD}=\frac{CD}{AD}.$$

> [!note|*] Problem 3 [Angle Bisector Theorem]
> 
Let $ABC$ be a triangle and let $S$ be a point on $BC$, such that $AS$ is an angle bisector in $\Delta ABC$. Prove that $$\frac{SB}{SC}=\frac{AB}{AC}.$$


_Sketch_: Let $D\in CA$, such that $AD = AB$.Note that $BD||AS$. So by the Thalesâ€™ Proportionality Theorem, we are done!
